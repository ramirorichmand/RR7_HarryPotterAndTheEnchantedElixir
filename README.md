## The Challenge 💡

As a personal challenge, I have set out to develop a Spring Boot backend application within 24 hours. The goal of the application is to manage information about magical potions in the Wizarding World. 

To achieve this, I will be implementing various Spring technologies such as Spring Data, Spring Data Queries, Spring database connection, and Spring JPA repositories. Additionally, I will be creating RESTful API endpoints for managing the potions. 

My goal is to demonstrate my proficiency in Spring and backend development while working efficiently under time constraints. 🎯

Stay tuned for updates on my progress! ⏳
